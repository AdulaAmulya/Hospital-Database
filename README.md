# Hospital-Database
This is a public repository containing a Microsoft SQL Server Management-backed database for a hospital. The database includes, patient details, Doctor details, appointment details, insurance company details,  diagnoses, treatments, and billing data for efficient healthcare management.

The project includes all the necessary files such as SQL queries sheet, Balsamiq file, ERD diagram, Excel sheet with table details, and the .bak file for the entire project.

The SQL queries sheet includes all the necessary queries for creating and managing the database. The queries are well-documented and structured to make it easy for anyone to understand and use.

The Balsamiq file is a visual representation of the database design. It provides an overview of the database schema and helps in understanding the relationships between the tables.

The ERD diagram is an entity-relationship diagram that provides a graphical representation of the database design. It shows the relationships between the tables and helps in understanding the data flow in the system.

The Excel sheet provides a detailed description of each table in the database. It includes the table name, data types, and a brief description of each column.

Finally, the .bak file includes the entire project and can be used to restore the database to its original state.

Overall, this database development project was designed with scalability, performance, and ease of use in mind. I hope that it will be useful for anyone looking to develop a similar database system or to learn more about database design and management.
